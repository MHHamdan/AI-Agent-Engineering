- ✅ Horizontal scalability ready
- ✅ Security-first approach (centralized gateway)
- ✅ Production-grade error handling

### MCP Protocol Compliance
- ✅ Tool discovery via MCP protocol
- ✅ Structured schemas with validation
- ✅ stdio transport implementation
- ✅ Cross-client compatibility (Claude Desktop, Cursor, custom clients)

---

## 📝 Reflection Highlights

The reflection paragraph in `week_03_hw_template.py` covers:

1. **Real-World Applications**: How each tool solves actual business problems
2. **MCP vs REST APIs**: Automatic discovery, standardized protocol, structured schemas
3. **MCP vs Function Calling**: Dynamic capability exposure, separation of concerns, cross-platform compatibility
4. **Security Benefits**: Controlled gateway, centralized auth, audit logging
5. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, stateless design, cloud-native deployment
6. **Business Impact**: Customer service automation, inventory management, executive dashboards, marketing campaigns

**Key Insight:** MCP is to AI agents what REST APIs were to web services - a standardizing protocol that enables safe, scalable enterprise integration.
