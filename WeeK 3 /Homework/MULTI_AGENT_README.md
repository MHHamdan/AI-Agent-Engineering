- **5** - Run All Scenarios

### Run Full Version (Requires OpenAI API)

1. Ensure `.env` file has valid API key with credits
2. Run:
```bash
uv run python multi_agent_system.py
```

## 🎬 Workflow Scenarios

**Workflow:**
1. Inventory Agent audits all products (PROD001-PROD005)
2. Identifies critical stock issues
3. Generates prioritized restocking recommendations

**MCP Tools Called:**
- `check_inventory_status` (multiple calls)

**Business Value:**
- Prevents stockouts
- Optimizes inventory levels
- Reduces lost sales

---

### Scenario 3: Daily Business Review

**Agents Involved:** Analytics, Inventory

**Workflow:**
1. Analytics Agent generates weekly sales report
2. Inventory Agent checks critical stock items
3. Combined insights for executive decision-making

**MCP Tools Called:**
- `generate_sales_report` → `check_inventory_status`

**Business Value:**
- Data-driven decision making
- Proactive problem identification
- Strategic planning support

---

### Scenario 4: Order Fulfillment Workflow

**Agents Involved:** Customer Service, Inventory

**Workflow:**
1. Retrieve order details (ORD002)
2. Inventory Agent verifies stock availability (PROD003)
3. Customer Service Agent processes shipment
4. Generates customer notification

**MCP Tools Called:**
- `process_order` (retrieve) → `check_inventory_status` → `process_order` (ship)

**Business Value:**
- Automated order processing
- Quality assurance (stock check before shipping)
- Improved customer communication

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each agent has specific domain expertise
   - Agents don't overlap in responsibilities
   - Clear interfaces between agents

2. **MCP Integration**
   - Agents use MCP tools as their "hands"
   - Centralized tool execution through `MCPToolExecutor`
   - Consistent error handling

3. **Simulated Intelligence**
   - Demo version uses rule-based logic
   - Full version uses LLM reasoning
   - Both produce professional outputs

## 📊 Example Output

## 🔧 Extending the System

### Add a New Agent

```python
class MarketingAgent(SimulatedAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Marketing Agent", "Marketing Manager")

    async def create_campaign(self, segment: str):
        # Get customer analytics
        # Generate marketing campaign
        # Use MCP tools as needed
        pass
```

### Add a New Workflow

```python
async def workflow_marketing_campaign():
    """New workflow for marketing campaigns."""
    marketing_agent = MarketingAgent()
    analytics_agent = AnalyticsAgent()

    # Coordinate agents for campaign creation
    segments = await analytics_agent.get_segments()
    campaign = await marketing_agent.create_campaign(segments)
    return campaign
```
