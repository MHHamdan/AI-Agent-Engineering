    "# Week 01 - Lesson 05 - Building AI Agents with Google ADK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), a powerful framework for building AI agents. You'll learn how ADK differs from other frameworks and how to create sophisticated single agents that can handle complex business scenarios.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. Understand ADK's framework\n",
    "2. Create single agents with clear identity and purpose\n",
    "3. Implement tools and instructions for agent behavior\n",
    "4. Manage agent state and sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Google ADK?\n",
    "\n",
    "Google ADK is designed specifically for **enterprise AI agent development** with several key advantages:\n",
    "- **Production-Ready**: Built for enterprise deployment and scaling\n",
    "- **Google Cloud Integration**: Native integration with Google's AI services\n",
    "- **Structured Approach**: Clear patterns for agent identity, tools, and behavior\n",
    "- **Session Management**: Built-in state management and conversation tracking\n",
    "- **Enterprise Security**: Designed with enterprise security and compliance in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts about the framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LlmAgent**: The core agent class for LLM-powered reasoning\n",
    "2. **Tools**: Functions that agents can call to interact with external systems\n",
    "3. **Instructions**: Clear guidance that shapes agent behavior and decision-making\n",
    "4. **Sessions**: Persistent state management for ongoing conversations\n",
    "5. **State**: Data that flows through your agent system"

    "## Getting Started with Google ADK\n",
    "\n",
    "Google ADK allows you to use different LLM providers, such as Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic.  \n",
    "You can use your **API key** from `Google AI Studio` (for Gemini), but you may also use your existing `OpenAI` keys if you have them.  \n",
    "This enables your agents to call different LLMs as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the examples in this notebook, make sure you have configured **AT LEAST ONE** valid API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔑 **OPENAI API KEY**: [Get you API Key from OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)\n",
    "Note: You will need to have credits in your OpenAI account to use the API key for LLM calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔑 **GOOGLE AI STUDIO API Key**: [Get your FREE API Key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)  \n",
    "You will need to sign in with your Google account and generate an API key.  \n",
    "This key allows your agents to connect with **Gemini models** and other Google AI services.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Configure your API keys in the environment before running the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To run the examples in this notebook, you only need to have at least one valid API key—either from OpenAI or from Google AI Studio (the latter is free).\n",
    "You do not need both. As long as you have one of these API keys configured, you will be able to use the LLM features demonstrated here.\n"

    "## 8. ADK vs Other Frameworks: Key Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Google’s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** provides a structured, production-ready framework for building scalable and secure AI agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ADK is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Orchestration**  \n",
    "  Combine deterministic workflow agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop) with LLM-driven adaptive routing for both predictable pipelines and dynamic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architecture**  \n",
    "  Build modular applications with specialized agents arranged in clear hierarchies, enabling delegation, scalability, and complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**  \n",
    "  Use pre-built tools (Search, Code Exec), integrate custom functions or third-party libraries, and even chain other agents as callable tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment Ready**  \n",
    "  Scale seamlessly with **Vertex AI Agent Engine**, **Cloud Run**, or Dockerized infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in Evaluation**  \n",
    "  Systematically test both final outputs and intermediate steps, ensuring reliability, compliance, and quality in enterprise settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety & Security by Design**  \n",
    "  Incorporate guardrails, policies, and best practices to build trustworthy, enterprise-grade agents aligned with compliance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **When to Choose ADK**  \n",
    "ADK is ideal for developers who need **hierarchical multi-agent systems**, seamless **Google Cloud integration**, and **built-in evaluation + deployment pipelines** — all within a framework that treats agents as reusable, software-like components.\n"
